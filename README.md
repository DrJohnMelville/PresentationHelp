Simple Audience Response System for Medical Peer Review.

This is a just a personal project.  I want a very specific feature, tracking sentiment over time, so that I can do case reviews with a physician's organization.  I want to build this very general so there are opportunities to have lots of different local plugins that do different
functionality with a minimal server component.
